        <h2>Welcome to our site let's begin our safari</h2>
        <p>
          A safari is a journey. This is the meaning of the word in Swahili, the
          language of East Africa. Your journey into Africa starts with
          Tanzania-Experience. When you join us on safari you will be met at the
          airport, taken to a hotel or a central meeting point and briefed
          before you set off. You will be transported in a well-maintained,
          clean Toyota 4×4 safari vehicle, driven by a professional local guide
          in areas that will leave you breathless with wonder and excitement.
          You will search for the ‘Big Five’ – buffalo, elephant, leopard, lion
          and rhino – and will be amazed by the sheer beauty of grass-covered
          savannas, extinct volcanoes and rare birds. You will see animals,
          landscapes and flowers and you will meet the local people and taste
          local food.
        </p>
        <h2>Adventure camping safari</h2>
        <p>
          On our adventure camping safaris you will be immersed in the East
          African wilderness. You will travel on rough adventurous roads, pass
          tiny rural settlements and see fascinating landscapes and abundant
          wildlife. All your senses will be involved; from smelling early
          morning coffee, experiencing the thrill of a kill to the chill of a
          morning game drive. Falling asleep to the hooting of an owl or waking
          up with the roaring of a lion is what you will experience. The safari
          experience is all the more intense as you are ‘right in the middle’ of
          it all. The nearness to the nature, especially at night with its
          nocturnal sounds, compensates for the luxury of a lodge. Our camping
          safaris in Tanzania offer all of this and are therefore perfect for
          nature lovers and those who are looking for a break from civilisation
          and its comforts. Camping is to experience East Africa’s nature,
          animals and cultures in an affordable way.

          <h3>National Parks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Serengeti</h4>
              <p>
                The best-known wildlife sanctuary in the world. Natural
                beauty,scientific value and the greatest concentration of plains
                game in Africa
              </p>
              <p>
                The Park can be divided into 3 sections. The popular
                southern/central part (Seronera Valley), is what the Maasai
                called the “serengit”, the land of endless plains. It’s classic
                savannah, dotted with acacias and filled with wildlife. The
                western corridor is marked by the Grumeti River, and has more
                forests and dense bush. The north, Lobo area, meets up with
                Kenya’s Masai Mara Reserve, is the least visited section.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Ngorongoro</h4>
              <p>
                The multiple land use philosophy in the area is to maintain the
                peaceful co-existence of human and wildlife in a natural and
                traditional setting.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main feature of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area include the
                Ngorongoro Crater, The Serengeti Plains that support about 2.0
                millions migratory wildlife species of the Serengeti
                Mara-ecosystem and the catchment forest; the Northern Highland
                Forest Reserve known as 'Entim Olturot' in Maasai language.
                Other important features found in the NCA are the archaeological
                and palaeontological site located at Oldupai Gorge and the early
                human foot-prints that were discovered at Alaitole in Ngarusi
                area.

            <li>
              <h4>Manyara</h4>
              <p>
                Located on the way to Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti, Lake
                Manyara National Park is worth a stop in its own right.
              </p>
              <p>
                The alkaline soda of Lake Manyara is home to an incredible array
                of bird life that thrives on its brackish waters. Pink flamingo
                stoop and graze by the thousands colourful specks against the
                grey minerals of the lake shore. Yellow-billed storks swoop and
                corkscrew on thermal winds rising up from the escarpment, and
                herons flap their wings against the sun-drenched sky. Even
                reluctant bird-watchers will find something to watch and marvel
                at within the national park.

            <li>
              <h4>Mikumi</h4>
              <p>
                Mikumi is Tanzania’s fourth-largest national park. With almost
                guaranteed wildlife sightings, it makes an ideal safari
                destination.

              <h4>Tarangire</h4>
              <p>
                It's sparse vegetation, strewn with baobab and acacia trees,
                makes it a beautiful and distinctive location to visit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tarangire National Park has some of the highest population
                density of elephants as compared to anywhere in Tanzania.
                Located just a few hours drive from the town of Arusha,
                Tarangire is a popular stop for people travelling through the
                northern safari circuit on their way to Ngorongoro and the
                Serengeti. The park extends into two game controlled areas and
                the wildlife is allowed to move freely throughout.

              </p>
              <p>

                safaris and African honeymoons, all the better for the ease of
                getting there and the lack of crowds. The park has the widest
                diversity of safari activities in the country, offering the
                boating safaris as well as standard game drives, walking safaris
                and legendary fly camping trips.

                Every day, thousands of people pass within a few kilometers of

                Dar-es-salaam)
              </p>
              <p>
                Set below the verdant slopes of the spectacular Usambara and
                Pare Eastern Arc Mountain Ranges and overseen by iconic snow –
                capped peak of Kilimanjaro, Mkomazi is a virgin breathtaking
                beauty exhibiting unique natural treasures and immense sense of
                space – which adds to the fulfillment of high visitor’s
                enjoyment expectations – a much needed bridge between northern
